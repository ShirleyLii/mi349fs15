      They always told us that one day we would move into a house, a real house
      that would be ours for always so we wouldn't have to move each year.
      Our house would be white with trees around it, a great big yard and grass
      growing without a fence.This was the house Papa talked about when he held a
      lottery ticket and this was the house Mama dreamed up in the stories she told
      us before we went to bed.
